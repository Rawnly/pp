# JSON Pretty Printer
> Easily beautify JSON in your terminal.

## Why?
I was used to use [json_pp](https://github.com/deftek/json_pp) but since I don't use PHP anymore
I don't want to install composer on my computers. So here we are, PPJ is a simple JSON pretty printer in NodeJs that 
runs natively thanks to [PKG](https://github.com/vercel/pkg)

## Usage
```sh
	cat package.json | ppj
```

## Installation

#### Binary
Download the latest release and move it into your `$PATH` 

#### NPM
```sh
	npm global install ppj
	
	# or
	
	yarn global add ppj
```

## Alternatives
- [json_pp](https://github.com/deftek/json_pp)
